# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Paketti Startup Wizard Guide

## Welcome, Brave Music Mage!

*I see you've summoned Paketti - the powerful pattern-based sorcery tool for Renoise. The interface may look like a magical grimoire with too many spells at once, but fear not! I shall guide you through the arcane arts of Paketti.*

## üéØ First Things First: What Do You Want to Conjure?

Before we dive into the sea of windows and menus, tell me your musical quest:

### Choose Your Path:

1. **Quick Bassline Creation** - "I want to make phat basslines fast!"
2. **Sample Sequencing** - "I need to sequence drum samples efficiently"
3. **Pattern Manipulation** - "I want to create complex pattern variations"
4. **Just Exploring** - "Show me what this magic can do!"

## üè∞ The Castle Layout: Understanding Paketti's Interface

### The Three Main Chambers:

**1. The Pattern Editor (Your Spellbook)**
- This is where you'll write your musical incantations
- Each track can have its own Paketti device
- Think of it as your main workspace

**2. The Tools Menu (Your Magic Wand)**
- Contains all the powerful spells (tools)
- Yes, it's overwhelming - we'll focus on the essential ones first
- Most tools are for advanced sorcery - ignore them for now

**3. The Device Parameters (Your Spell Components)**
- Where you adjust the magic (sample settings, effects, etc.)
- Accessible by clicking on the Paketti device in your track

## üîÆ Essential Spells for Beginners
