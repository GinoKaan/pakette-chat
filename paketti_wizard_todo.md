# Paketti Startup Wizard - Todo Items

## Workflow Selection Screen
- [ ] MPC-Style Beat Making (play samples on pads and sequence patterns)
- [ ] Bassline Sequencing (create synth bass patterns)
- [ ] Melodic Pattern Work (create melodies and hooks)
- [ ] Experimental Sound Design (create evolving textures and effects)
- [ ] I'm not sure, show me examples

## MPC Workflow - Sample Loading
- [ ] Browse button to select sample file
- [ ] Auto-slice detection for transients
- [ ] Manual slice point adjustment
- [ ] Threshold slider for sensitivity
- [ ] Next button when satisfied

## MPC Workflow - Pad Mapping
- [ ] Visual 4x4 pad grid representation
- [ ] MIDI Learn functionality for controller assignment
- [ ] Drag and drop slice assignment
- [ ] Test button for slice preview
- [ ] Next button when all slices assigned

## MPC Workflow - Pattern Setup
- [ ] Pattern length selection (1, 2, 4, 8 bars)
- [ ] Grid resolution options (1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 notes)
