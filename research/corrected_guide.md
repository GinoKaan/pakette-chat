# Paketti for Renoise: Corrected Quick Start Guide

## What This Guide Corrects

The original chat conversation contained extensive misinformation about Paketti. This guide corrects those errors and provides accurate information based on the official Paketti documentation at https://esaruoho.github.io/paketti-manual/

---

## CRITICAL CORRECTION: What Paketti Actually Is

### The Hallucination
The original conversation described Paketti as a system of "devices" you add to tracks, mentioning:
- "Paketti Bassline" device
- "Paketti Sampler" device
- "Paketti Drum Machine" device
- "Paketti Pattern Sampler" device
- Adding "Paketti" or "Pocket" devices by right-clicking device slots

### The Reality
**Paketti is NOT a device or plugin system.** Paketti is a comprehensive Lua tool/script collection that adds:
- Over 6,000 keyboard shortcuts
- 3,000+ menu entries
- 1,000+ MIDI mappings
- Utility functions accessible through Renoise's Tools menu and keyboard shortcuts

Paketti enhances Renoise's existing functionality but does not create new "devices" or "instruments" that you insert into tracks. It works WITH Renoise's native instruments, samples, effects, and pattern system.

## Getting Started with Paketti: The CORRECT Way

### Installation
1. Install Paketti through Renoise's tool system
2. Once installed, you'll see numerous new entries in the Tools menu
3. Many new keyboard shortcuts become available

### First-Time User Experience
The hallucinated conversation correctly identified that Paketti presents an "overwhelming" number of options when first opened. This is accurate - Paketti adds thousands of menu items and shortcuts.

**However, the solution is NOT to look for "Paketti devices" to add to tracks.**

### Correct Understanding
Instead of thinking "I need to add a Paketti device," think:
- "I need to load/edit samples" → Use Paketti's sample tools from the Tools menu
- "I need to edit patterns" → Use Paketti's pattern editing shortcuts
- "I need to automate parameters" → Use Paketti's automation tools
- "I need to manage instruments" → Use Paketti's instrument utilities

## Correcting the MPC-Style Workflow Request

### What the User Wanted
The user asked: "I want to take a breakbeat I have and have it automapped to my controller pads. Then I want to bang out a beat, like an MPC, hear it played back and add other elements building a song."

### The Hallucinated Response
The conversation suggested:
- Adding a "Paketti Drum Machine" or "Paketti Pattern Sampler" device
- Loading samples into Paketti devices
- Using MIDI Learn within Paketti devices

**All of this is FALSE.**

### The CORRECT Approach

Paketti does NOT provide MPC-style pad mapping devices. For the MPC workflow, you would use:

#### Step 1: Load Your Breakbeat (Renoise Native + Paketti Tools)
1. Load your breakbeat sample into a Renoise instrument
2. Use Renoise's native slicing tools OR use Paketti's slice manipulation tools from the Tools menu
3. Renoise will automatically map slices to keyboard notes (C-4, C#4, D-4, etc.)

#### Step 2: MIDI Controller Mapping (Renoise Native)
This is done through Renoise's native MIDI mapping, NOT through Paketti:
1. Go to Edit → Preferences → MIDI
2. Map your controller pads to the note values where your slices are assigned
3. This is standard Renoise functionality, not Paketti-specific

#### Step 3: Recording and Sequencing (Renoise Native)
1. Enable pattern recording in Renoise
2. Play your controller pads - hits are recorded as notes in the pattern editor
3. Edit patterns using Renoise's pattern editor

#### Step 4: Where Paketti Helps
Once you have your basic beat recorded, Paketti provides workflow enhancements:
- **Pattern manipulation**: Use Paketti's pattern doubling, rotation, and fill tools
- **Sample editing**: Use Paketti's sample manipulation tools for further refinement
- **Automation**: Use Paketti's advanced automation tools for dynamic effects
- **Track management**: Use Paketti shortcuts for quick track duplication and organization

## Correcting Sample Loading Instructions

### The Hallucination
The conversation described loading samples "in Paketti" with instructions like:
- Click on "Sample" tab within Paketti device
- Click "Sample" field to open file browser in Paketti
- Assign samples to keys within Paketti devices

### The Reality
Paketti does not have its own sample loading system. You load samples through:

1. **Renoise's Native Instrument/Sample System**
   - Drag and drop samples into the instrument list
   - Use the Disk Browser to load samples
   - Standard Renoise sample editor is used

2. **Paketti's Sample Enhancement Tools**
   - After loading samples in Renoise, use Paketti tools from the Tools menu for:
     - Advanced slice manipulation
     - Sample editing operations
     - Drum kit loading utilities
     - Automatic macro configurations

**Key Point**: Paketti enhances Renoise's sample workflow but doesn't replace it with a separate "Paketti sample system."

## Understanding the Menu Overwhelm: The Real Solution

### The Problem (Correctly Identified)
The hallucinated conversation correctly noted that users face:
- Overwhelming menu sprawl in the Tools menu
- Unclear entry points for common workflows
- Too many options visible at once

### The Hallucinated Solution
The conversation proposed a "Startup Wizard" with workflow selections like "MPC-Style Beat Making" that would configure Paketti devices.

### The Reality
Since Paketti doesn't create devices, a startup wizard wouldn't work as described. However, the concept of workflow-oriented guidance is valid:

#### Practical Approaches for Managing Paketti Complexity

1. **Start with Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Paketti's power comes from shortcuts, not menu hunting
   - Use the Keybindings viewer (a Paketti utility) to see available shortcuts
   - Learn shortcuts gradually for the workflows you use most

2. **Focus on Your Workflow**
   - If you do pattern editing: Learn Paketti's pattern manipulation shortcuts
   - If you work with samples: Learn Paketti's sample editing tools
   - If you automate heavily: Learn Paketti's automation features

3. **Use Paketti's Built-in Help**
   - Effect cheat sheet shows available effects and their shortcuts
   - Keybindings viewer lists all keyboard mappings
   - Documentation at https://esaruoho.github.io/paketti-manual/

4. **Gradual Adoption**
   - You don't need to use all 6,000+ shortcuts
   - Start with a few tools that match your workflow
   - Expand your Paketti usage as needed

## Correct Workflow Examples

### Workflow 1: Creating a Beat with Samples

**Using Renoise + Paketti (Correct Method)**

1. **Load samples** (Renoise native):
   - Create a new instrument
   - Load kick, snare, hihat samples into sample slots
   - Assign each to different notes (or use auto-mapping)

2. **Create pattern** (Renoise native):
   - Use the pattern editor to place notes where you want hits
   - Or record in real-time with MIDI controller

3. **Enhance with Paketti**:
   - Use pattern doubling to extend your beat (Paketti tool)
   - Use pattern rotation to create variations (Paketti tool)
   - Use automation drawing tools for filter sweeps (Paketti tool)

### Workflow 2: Building a Bassline

**Using Renoise + Paketti (Correct Method)**

1. **Load bass sound** (Renoise native):
   - Load a bass sample or synthesizer plugin
   - Configure in Renoise's instrument editor

2. **Sequence the bassline** (Renoise native):
   - Write notes in the pattern editor
   - Add effects (filters, distortion) using Renoise's DSP chain

3. **Enhance with Paketti**:
   - Use transpose tools to quickly shift the bassline (Paketti)
   - Use pattern fill tools to extend the pattern (Paketti)
   - Use automation tools for dynamic filtering (Paketti)

### Workflow 3: Slicing and Sequencing Breaks

**Using Renoise + Paketti (Correct Method)**

1. **Load breakbeat** (Renoise native):
   - Drag breakbeat sample into a new instrument
   - Use Renoise's slicer to create slices at transients

2. **Additional slice manipulation** (Paketti tools):
   - Access Tools menu → Paketti → Slice tools
   - Use Paketti's advanced slice manipulation if needed

3. **Sequence slices** (Renoise native):
   - Slices are mapped to keys automatically
   - Place notes in pattern editor to trigger slices

4. **Create variations** (Paketti):
   - Use pattern rotation tools to rearrange slice playback
   - Use pattern fill and doubling for variations

## Conclusion

The original conversation was well-intentioned but fundamentally misunderstood what Paketti is. The AI in that conversation consistently described Paketti as a device/plugin system similar to VST instruments, when in reality it's a comprehensive toolkit that extends Renoise's existing functionality through scripts, shortcuts, and menu commands.

The core workflow philosophy is correct: Paketti can seem overwhelming and benefits from workflow-oriented learning. However, the solution isn't to look for "Paketti devices" to insert - it's to learn which Paketti tools and shortcuts enhance YOUR specific workflow in Renoise.

For MPC-style beat making, you use Renoise's native sampling and sequencing capabilities, potentially enhanced by Paketti's pattern manipulation and sample editing tools. For bassline creation, you use Renoise's instruments and pattern editor, potentially enhanced by Paketti's transpose and automation tools. For any music creation task, Paketti is there to speed up and enhance your workflow, not to replace Renoise's core functionality with a separate system.

**Remember**: Paketti is a workflow accelerator, not a device library. Master Renoise first, then let Paketti supercharge your workflow.
