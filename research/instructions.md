# Research Mission

## Context
The file `main.md` contains an AI conversation filled with hallucinations about Pakette. Many tools and methods described don't exist. Other files were made by the AI intended to be quick start, wizards, workflow instructions. They are written well but are entirely hallucinated.

## Your Task
1. Read the hallucinated chat
2. Study the real Pakette documentation.
3. Search Renoise forums for actual Pakette usage for deep research into origins of tools and usage evolution.
4. Create `corrected_guide.md` that:
   - Identifies what the original chat tried to teach
   - Explains the CORRECT way to do those things
   - Uses only real Pakette features from official docs
   - Can stand on its own as a quick start guide for workflows mentioned in original chat.
