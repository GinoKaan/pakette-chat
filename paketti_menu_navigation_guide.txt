PAKETTI MENU NAVIGATION GUIDE - Solving the "Where's My Device?" Mystery

WHAT YOU'RE SEEING:
When you right-click to add a device, you likely see:
- Paketti
- Paketti Gadgets

INSIDE "Paketti" you might see:
- Paketti Bassline
- Paketti Sampler  
- Paketti Arpeggiator
- Paketti Chord
- Paketti Drum
- And many more...

BUT IF YOU DON'T SEE THESE:
The menu structure might be different in your version. Let's troubleshoot:

STEP 1: Check your exact menu path
- Right-click on a track device slot
- Look for "Paketti" (not "Paketti Gadgets")
- What EXACT options appear under "Paketti"?

STEP 2: Alternative locations to check:
- Try the main Renoise menu: Tools → Paketti → Add Device
- Or check: Insert → Instrument → Paketti

STEP 3: If still missing, you might need to:
- Ensure Paketti is properly installed
- Check if you're using the latest version
- Restart Renoise

QUICK FIX: Try searching for "bass" or "sampler" in the device browser if available.

Please tell me what you ACTUALLY see when you right-click and go to Paketti - this will help me give you exact instructions!
