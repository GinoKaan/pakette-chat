üéõÔ∏è PAKETTI QUICK START GUIDE - For the Overwhelmed User

=== THE INITIAL CONFUSION ===
You're seeing two main categories when right-clicking:
1. "Paketti" - The main pattern-based sequencing tools
2. "Paketti Gadgets" - Utility/helper tools

=== START HERE - 3 SIMPLE STEPS ===

STEP 1: IGNORE THE GADGETS FOR NOW
- Just use the basic "Paketti" device (not the gadgets)
- This is your main sample/pattern sequencer

STEP 2: UNDERSTAND THE HIERARCHY
Paketti ‚Üí [Various Tools] ‚Üí [Even More Options]
The complexity comes from Paketti being a "toolbox" rather than a single tool

STEP 3: RECOMMENDED FIRST CHOICE
Use "Paketti Bassline" or "Paketti Sampler" - these are the most straightforward starting points

=== WHAT'S HAPPENING? ===
Paketti is like opening a Swiss Army knife where every tool is visible at once. The default Renoise way is like having one tool at a time.

=== NEXT STEPS ===
1. Add "Paketti Bassline" to a track
2. Click the device to open its panel
3. Load a sample using the sample browser
4. Use pattern commands to sequence it

Remember: You don't need to understand all the gadgets immediately. Start with one basic Paketti device and expand as needed!
